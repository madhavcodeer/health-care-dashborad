# Data
# healthcare_cleaned.csv # Keeping this un-ignored as user might want data in repo, but usually data is ignored. 
# Given the user instruction "add the data ... and make the dashboard", and it's a demo/portfolio project, I'll update .gitignore to NOT ignore the csv if it's small, but here it is ~200kb so it's fine.
